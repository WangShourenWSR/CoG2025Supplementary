## Chain of Thought Reasoning ###
The player is currently experiencing a winning streak (3 wins in a row) with their character Ryu. They have also shown a high win rate of 83.33%, suggesting they are skilled. The player's feedback also indicates they found the last match too simple. Therefore, it's crucial to provide a challenging opponent but still balanced in difficulty. Given the player's preferences for higher intensity matches, I should avoid choosing an easy type. The player has faced few characters and types (mainly projectile and aggressive types), so I should consider a new type or character that can provide variety. Considering the recent feedback of the match being too simple, I should choose a character that offers more challenge and strategy. Given these conditions, I will select an aggressive type model but with a different character from either E. Honda or Vega, considering that they've faced these characters before. Additionally, the player prefers to face challenging opponents, so I will avoid characters that the player has already faced a few times.

Given these evaluations, I have decided to choose an aggressive type character but avoid the ones the player has faced previously.
