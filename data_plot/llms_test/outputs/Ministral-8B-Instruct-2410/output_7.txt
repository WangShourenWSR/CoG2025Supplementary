## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The player has a win rate of 83%, with a current winning streak of 3 matches and no losses. They requested a more challenging opponent. The player predominantly uses special moves (an average of 9.5 per match) and has faced multiple types including projectile, defensive, and aggressive types.

Given their preferences and the diversity of opponents faced so far, it would challenge the player to face an agent of projectile-type. Although the player has previously faced projectiles, it is a lesser type compared to defensive or aggressive ones. Moreover, the player's feedback indicates they desire more complexity in gameplay.

Thus, choose a projectile-type agent that presents a middle-of-the-road difficulty to maintain the balance between challenging gameplay and the player's skill level. The agent that best meets these criteria is a projectile-type agent with a difficulty score of "6/10". From the agent archive, the agent with the suggested model path of "agent_models/agents_archive/projectile_type/2_0.2" will be chosen. Additionally, since the player likes Sagat and has faced some suggested projectile characters before, but less so, the agent character will be Sagat.

## Final Decision
{
    "chosen_agent_type": "projectile_type",
    "chosen_agent_model_path": "agent_models/agents_archive/projectile_type/2_0.2",
    "chosen_agent_character": "Sagat"
}
