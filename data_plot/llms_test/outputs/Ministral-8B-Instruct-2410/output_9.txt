### Chain of Thought Reasoning:
The player is in a strong winning streak with a total win rate of 83%. They have faced a mix of characters and types but have a good balance between different playstyles. However, in their last match, they indicated the opponent was too simple, suggesting they want more challenge.

They have already faced "projectile_type" agents three times. The feedback indicates a preference for more challenge. Their average per match and special moves suggest an intermediate skill level. Therefore, it is essential to choose a more challenging agent, preferably with a different strategy to keep the enjoyment high.

Considering the above, an "aggressive_type" agent with Sagat seems suitable, as the player has faced him only once before. This type and character will provide more challenge and variety while addressing the player's feedback.
Based on the provided conditions, the player desires a more challenging opponent.
