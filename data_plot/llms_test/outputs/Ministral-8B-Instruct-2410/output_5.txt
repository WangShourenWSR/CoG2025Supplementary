## Chain of Thought Reasoning:
The player has a high win rate (83%) and is currently on a winning streak of 3 matches.
However, the last opponent was considered too simple according to the player's feedback.
Therefore, I will select a more challenging opponent of the same type ("aggressive_type") but with different character and model.
Considering the player used more than 9.5 special moves per match, they are comfortable with this game.

The agent type "defensive_type" has the lowest diversity rating because the player faced many "aggressive_type" (1 time) and did not face other types at all.
Meanwhile, "air_type" has the second lowest diversity rating because the player only faced this type once.

Given the player's latest feedback, I will choose another "aggressive_type" opponent.
Considering the player prefers tougher opponents based on the last match rating, let's choose the agent's model with a difficulty score of 8 out of 10.

I will ensure the agent type is "aggressive_type" with the "Ryu" character and model path "agent_models/agents_archive/aggressive_type/1_0.22".

  "chosen_agent_type": "aggressive_type",
