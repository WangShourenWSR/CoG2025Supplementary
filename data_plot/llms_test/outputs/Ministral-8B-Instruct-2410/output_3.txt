 A Chain of Thought reasoning part and one JSON object, as shown in the example above.
###json
{
    "chosen_agent_type": "projectile_type",
    "chosen_agent_model_path": "agent_models/agents_archive/projectile_type/lstm_projectile2",
    "chosen_agent_character": "Sagat"
}

To enhance the user's enjoyment, let's analyze the data provided:

1. The player is currently on a lengthy winning streak, indicating they are skilled and ready for a more challenging opponent.
2. The player has already faced a variety of opponents, suggesting interest in versatility. However, their feedback indicates current matches were not challenging enough.
3. Considering these factors, the new opponent should be of medium difficulty to challenge the player while maintaining fun. Projectile types seem suitable for diversity.

Considering the player's win rate, win streak, and character choice (Ryu), we can conclude they may prefer opponents with more engaging mechanics like projectiles. Thus, a projectile type model with a medium difficulty level seems optimal.

Therefore, choose the "projectile_type" with the model and character paths provided in the Agent Archive.

}
