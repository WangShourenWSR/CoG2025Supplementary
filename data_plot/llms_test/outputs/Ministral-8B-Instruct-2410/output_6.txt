This human player has a high win rate (83.33%) and is currently on a winning streak of 3 matches. They have faced 3 aggressive-type opponents already. However, the player has expressed their latest opponent was too easy. Therefore, to maintain the difficulty and keep providing meaningful challenges to the human player, I should recommend a more challenging agent. They have also faced a defensive-type agent, but none of the other types yet. Given their skill level, an air-type agent seems appropriate, providing a different playstyle and challenge. Although the air-type agent is rated "Easy," it will still provide a more engaging match-up.

The previous agent was EHonda, which is an aggressive_type. Therefore, I will select a different type--air_type--for this match, as per the principle of "opponent diversity." Given their skill, an air_type agent would give enough challenge without being overly easy. The air_type character will be Dhalsim, as this is a character they haven't faced before. Additionally, the agent suggested for the air_type in the agent archive model is suitable for this player.

The playing_data indicates that the player has only faced EHonda (aggressive_type) and no defensive_type agents. Therefore, a projectile_type, special_move_type, and newbie_type are not selected, as they were the ones faced during previous matches. Thus, choosing the air_type for this match will provide a fresh and different challenge.
