**Chain of Thought Reasoning:**

The player has a win rate of 83% and is currently on a win streak of 3. However, the player reports that the last opponent was too simplistic, indicating a need for a more challenging agent. Based on the Principle for Opponent Selection and the player's preference, we should choose an opponent with a harder difficulty level.

Given the player's preference for challenging opponents, we should avoid repeating the same types of opponents or characters. The last opponent was of the "aggressive_type" with the character "EHonda", so we should choose a different type or character. Projectile and special move types are suitable alternatives that provide difficulty.

We should choose an option that is neither too hard nor too easy. An agent with a difficulty score of 6/10 (Medium) should be suitable.

Based on the Agent Archive, the model with a difficulty score of 6/10 (Medium) under "projectile_type" is a good choice. Since the player has not faced "Dhalsim" or "Sagat" before, we can choose "Sagat". This will provide the player with a new challenge while keeping the difficulty at an appropriate level.
