**Chain of Thought Reasoning:**

The player has a high win rate (0.833) and a current win streak of 3, indicating they are performing exceptionally well. Their feedback suggests they found the last match too simple, which implies they are looking for a more challenging opponent to enhance their gameplay experience. 

Considering the playing data, the player has faced a variety of agents but has not encountered many from the aggressive type. Selecting an aggressive opponent would provide a different challenge, which aligns with the goal of balancing difficulty and diversity. The aggressive type agents are suggested to have characters like Ryu, Ken, EHonda, Zangief, Balrog, Sagat, and Bison, all of whom have distinct playstyles. 

Among the aggressive type agents, the model_path "agent_models/agents_archive/aggressive_type/1_0.22" is rated as Hard, which fits the need for increased difficulty. The character EHonda is a strong choice for this type, as they are aggressive and have a good mix of aerial attacks and other offensive techniques, which should provide a good challenge without overwhelming the player.
