The player has a high win rate and a winning streak, indicating they are performing well. To keep it challenging yet fun, the opponent should be of medium difficulty. The player has faced EHonda and Vega before, so a new type is needed. The aggressive type offers a good balance, with characters like Ryu, Ken, and Sagat. Among these, Sagat is a strong choice due to their projectile and aerial strengths, providing a varied challenge without overwhelming the player.
