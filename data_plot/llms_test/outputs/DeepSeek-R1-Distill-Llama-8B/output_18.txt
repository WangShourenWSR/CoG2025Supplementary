```json
{
    "chosen_agent_type": "aggressive_type",
    "chosen_agent_model_path": "agent_models/agents_archive/aggressive_type/1_0.22",
    "chosen_agent_character": "EHonda"
}
```

**Chain of Thought Reasoning:**

The player has a high win rate (0.8333) and is currently on a 3-match win streak, indicating they are performing well. The last opponent was of "aggressive_type" with "EHonda," which the player found too simple. To maintain challenge and diversity, selecting another "aggressive_type" opponent makes sense. "EHonda" is a good fit as it offers varied strategies without overwhelming the player, keeping the difficulty balanced.
