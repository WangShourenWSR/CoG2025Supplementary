 Chain of Thought first, then JSON.
Chain of Thought Reasoning:
The player has a high win rate and is on a winning streak, indicating a skilled player. They have primarily faced aggressive and projectile-type opponents, so we should introduce a defensive or special move-type opponent for diversity. They used many special moves recently, suggesting they can handle advanced AI. They mentioned the last match was too easy, indicating they desire a challenge. Therefore, we should select an agent that provides a good challenge without overwhelming them. A special move-type opponent would be suitable as it offers a unique strategy and is challenging enough. The agent_models/special_move_type/1_0.25 model fits this criteria well.
