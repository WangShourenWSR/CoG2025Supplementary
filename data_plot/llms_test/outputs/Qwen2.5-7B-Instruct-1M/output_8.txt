 Chain of Thought first, then a JSON object.
Chain of Thought Reasoning:
Based on the provided playing_data, the player has a high win rate of 83.33%, is currently on a winning streak, and uses special moves frequently. They have faced mostly aggressive and projectile types in their previous matches. The player's feedback indicates they find the last match too easy, suggesting they are ready for a more challenging opponent. To enhance their enjoyment while maintaining challenge, we should select an opponent that is neither too weak nor too overwhelming. 

Given the player's preference for a more challenging match and the avoidance of repetitive opponents, we should choose an opponent that is distinct in strategy from the last match. The last opponent was aggressive and of the EHonda character, so we should avoid selecting another aggressive type or EHonda. Considering the player's average score per match is relatively high, we can infer they are skilled enough to handle a more challenging opponent without being overwhelmed. 

From the agent archive, the projectile type would be a good choice as it offers variety and is distinct from the last opponent. The suggested characters for this type include Ryu, Ken, Sagat, and Dhalsim. Since the player is currently using Ryu, choosing another character from this type would add diversity. The model "agent_models/agents_archive/projectile_type/2_0.2" has a medium difficulty level, making it suitable for the player's current skill level.
