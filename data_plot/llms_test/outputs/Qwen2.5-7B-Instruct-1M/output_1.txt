 Chain of Thought first, then JSON.
Chain of Thought Reasoning:
Based on the provided playing_data, the player is currently on a winning streak with a high win rate (83.3%) and has used special moves frequently (9.5 per match). They have faced aggressive-type opponents and Ryu twice before, so they might be familiar with his playstyle. To enhance their enjoyment, we need to challenge them while maintaining a positive experience. Given their feedback about the last match being too simple, we should aim for a more challenging opponent. 

Considering the player's high skill level and recent performance, we can select an aggressive-type opponent. Among the available agents, the "aggressive_type" model with "model_path" "agent_models/agents_archive/aggressive_type/1_0.22" seems appropriate as it offers a high difficulty score (8/10) and has not been used recently. This choice will provide a balanced challenge without overwhelming the player. Additionally, the player hasn't faced "EHonda" or "Sagat" many times, so including either of these characters would introduce some diversity in terms of character and playstyle.
```json
{
    "chosen_agent_type": "aggressive_type",
    "chosen_agent_model_path": "agent_models/agents_archive/aggressive_type/1_0.22",
    "chosen_agent_character": "EHonda"
}
```
