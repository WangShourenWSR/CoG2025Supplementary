 Chain of Thought first, then JSON.
Chain of Thought Reasoning:
The player has a high win rate (83%) and is on a winning streak, indicating they are skilled and have been facing relatively easy opponents. They used special moves frequently in previous matches, suggesting they are not a beginner. The player's last opponent was of the aggressive type, and they felt the match was too simple. Therefore, to enhance enjoyment, we should challenge the player with a new and varied opponent. The player has not faced many projectile-type opponents, making it a good choice for diversity. Additionally, the player's feedback suggests they need a more challenging opponent, so we should select a medium-difficulty model. The "projectile_type" agent archive provides a suitable model that fits these criteria.
