Chain of Thought:

The player has a high win rate of 83.33% and is on a winning streak of 3 matches. This indicates that the player is performing well and may be looking for a challenge. However, the player's recent feedback suggests that the opponent was too simple, with the enemy not performing any effective attacks. This feedback implies that the current opponent may not be providing enough challenge or variety.

Considering the principles for opponent selection, the difficulty adjustment should be made to still challenge the player but not overwhelm them. Since the player's win rate is high, selecting a slightly stronger opponent would be appropriate. The opponent should also be of a different type to provide variety in play styles.

Looking at the suggested characters for the aggressive_type, which includes characters like Ryu, Ken, EHonda, Zangief, Balrog, Sagat, and Bison. The aggressive_type agents are known for their strong attacks and can provide a good balance of challenge and variety.

The aggressive_type has a model with a difficulty score of 8/10-(Hard), which is suitable for a player with a high win rate and recent feedback suggesting the need for more challenge.

Chain of Thought reasoning:

The aggressive_type offers a good balance of strength and variety, aligning with the player's current performance level and feedback. The chosen model for aggressive_type has a difficulty score of 8/10, which is challenging but not overwhelming.
