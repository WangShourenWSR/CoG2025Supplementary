Chain of Thought: The player has a high win rate, indicating they are performing well. The last opponent was aggressive, which might be too challenging for them. To balance difficulty, I should choose a defensive type opponent. The player hasn't faced Chunli yet, making them a good new challenge. Chunli's model has a difficulty score of 8/10, which is hard but manageable for the player. This choice supports the player's win streak and introduces new defensive strategies.
