The player's current win rate is 83.33%, indicating they are performing well. However, their recent feedback suggests they find the current match too simple, indicating a desire for a more challenging opponent. Considering the player's recent performance and feedback, I will choose an opponent that is more challenging but still within their skill level. The player has faced Vega and EHonda twice and Sagat once, so I will select an opponent they have not faced frequently.
