### Chain of Thought Reasoning

To choose the next opponent for the human player, I need to consider the player's recent performance, the difficulty level, and the diversity of opponents. The player has a high win rate of 83.33% and is on a winning streak of 3 matches. This suggests that they are currently performing well and can handle a more challenging opponent.

The player has faced a variety of agents, but the most frequently faced types are projectile and special move types. To introduce some diversity, I will choose an opponent from a different type.

The player's feedback indicates that the current match is too simple, which suggests that they are looking for a more challenging opponent. However, they have not explicitly requested a specific type or character.

Based on the player's recent performance and feedback, I will choose an opponent from the defensive type, which is a more challenging type compared to projectile and special move types. The defensive type is also less frequently faced by the player, which will introduce some diversity.

The suggested characters for the defensive type are Vega, Ryu, Ken, Dhalsim, and Sagat. Considering the player's current character is Ryu, I will choose a different character to provide some variety.

The agent models for the defensive type have a difficulty score of 8/10, which is suitable for the player's current level of performance.

Therefore, I will choose an opponent from the defensive type with a difficulty score of 8/10 and a suggested character of Vega.
