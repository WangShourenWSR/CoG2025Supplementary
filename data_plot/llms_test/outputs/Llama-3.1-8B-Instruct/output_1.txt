Here is my Chain of Thought reasoning:
The player has a high win rate (0.833) and is currently on a winning streak (3 matches). This suggests that they are performing well and can handle a stronger opponent. I will choose an opponent that is more challenging but still within their skill level.

The player has faced "Vega" and "EHonda" twice, and "Sagat" once. To provide diversity, I will choose an opponent that they have not faced before or have faced only a few times. The player has used special moves frequently (average of 9.5 per match), indicating that they are skilled and can handle advanced AI.

Considering the player's feedback, they found the last match too simple. I will choose an opponent that is more challenging and requires effective attacks. I will select an opponent from the "aggressive_type" category, as it is more likely to provide a challenging match.

From the Agent Archive, I will choose an agent model that is difficult (difficulty score of 8/10) and has a suggested character that is suitable for the aggressive type. I will select the "aggressive_type" category and choose an agent model that is difficult but not overwhelming.

Based on the player's recent performance and feedback, I will choose an opponent that is challenging but still within their skill level. I will select an opponent from the "aggressive_type" category and choose an agent model that is difficult (difficulty score of 8/10) and has a suggested character that is suitable for the aggressive type.

The player's current character is "Ryu", and they have faced "Vega" and "EHonda" twice, and "Sagat" once. To provide diversity, I will choose an opponent that they have not faced before or have faced only a few times. The player has used special moves frequently (average of 9.5 per match), indicating that they are skilled and can handle advanced AI.
