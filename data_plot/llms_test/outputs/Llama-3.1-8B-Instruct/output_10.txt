### Chain of Thought Reasoning:

Given the player's recent performance and feedback, I need to choose an opponent that will challenge them but still be enjoyable. The player has a high win rate and is on a winning streak, so I will choose a stronger opponent. However, the player has also provided feedback that the last match was too simple, so I will avoid choosing an opponent that is too easy. 

The player has faced the "EHonda" character before and has a high win rate, so I will choose a different character. I will also choose an opponent that has a different play style to provide variety. 

Considering the player's average score and special moves per match, I will choose an opponent that is not too easy or too hard. The player has faced the "projectile_type" and "special_move_type" characters before, so I will choose a different type. 

Based on the player's feedback and recent performance, I will choose an opponent that is challenging but still enjoyable. I will select the "aggressive_type" character, as it is a different play style and the player has not faced it before. 

From the Agent Archive, I will choose an agent model that has a difficulty score of around 7-8/10. I will select the "model_path" from the "aggressive_type" character, as it has a difficulty score of 8/10-(Hard).

### JSON Output:

  "chosen_agent_model_path": "agent_models/agents_archive/aggressive_type/1_0.22",
  "chosen_agent_character": "EHonda"
}
