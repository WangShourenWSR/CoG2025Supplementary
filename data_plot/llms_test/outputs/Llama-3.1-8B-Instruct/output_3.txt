Based on the provided playing data, the player is currently on a winning streak with a high win rate of 0.8333333333333334. However, the player's feedback suggests that the current match is too simple, indicating a need for a more challenging opponent. Considering the player's recent performance and feedback, I will choose an opponent that is more difficult but not overwhelmingly so.

To balance difficulty and variety, I will select an agent type that is not too similar to the last opponent, which was of aggressive type. I will also consider the player's average special moves per match, which is 9.5, indicating a moderate level of skill. This suggests that the player can handle a more challenging opponent.

From the Agent Archive, I will choose an agent type that is not too easy or too hard for the player. I will select the "projectile_type" agent type, which is suggested for characters like Ryu, Ken, Sagat, and Dhalsim. This type is likely to provide a good balance of difficulty and variety.
