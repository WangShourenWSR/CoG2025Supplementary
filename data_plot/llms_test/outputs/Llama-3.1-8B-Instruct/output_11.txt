 

**Chain of Thought Reasoning**
Considering the player's win rate (0.8333333333333334) and current win streak (3), I should choose a stronger opponent to maintain a challenging game. However, the player's feedback suggests that the last match was too simple, so I should avoid overwhelming them with an overly difficult opponent. The player has faced Ryu and Vega before, so I should choose an agent with a different play style. Based on the faced_agents_times and faced_characters_times, the player has not faced a defensive-type agent before, so I should select one. The player's average special moves per match (9.5) suggests they are skilled, so I should choose a challenging agent. The player's current character is Ryu, and the suggested characters for the defensive-type agent are Ryu, Vega, and others. I should choose a character that is not Ryu to provide variety.
