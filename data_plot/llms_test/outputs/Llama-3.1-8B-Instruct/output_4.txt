The player's current win rate is 83.33%, indicating a high level of skill. However, the player's feedback suggests that the last match was too simple, implying a desire for a more challenging opponent. Considering the player's recent performance, I will choose a stronger opponent to maintain engagement. The player has faced various opponents, but the "aggressive_type" has been encountered only once. Therefore, I will select an opponent from the "aggressive_type" category to provide a fresh experience.

The player's average special moves per match is 9.5, indicating a good understanding of special moves. To provide a balanced challenge, I will choose an opponent with a high difficulty score but not too high to overwhelm the player. The "aggressive_type" has a suggested character list that includes Ryu, Ken, EHonda, Zangief, Balrog, Sagat, and Bison. I will select a character that is not Ryu, as the player has already faced him twice.

Considering the player's feedback and recent performance, I will choose an opponent that is challenging but not overwhelming. The "aggressive_type" has a model difficulty score of 8/10, which is suitable for the player's skill level. I will select a model path that corresponds to this difficulty score.
