Here is my Chain of Thought reasoning:
Based on the provided playing data, the player has a high win rate (83.33%) and is currently on a winning streak (3 matches). This suggests that the player is skilled and can handle a more challenging opponent. The player has also provided feedback that the current match is too simple, indicating that they are looking for a more engaging experience.

To balance difficulty and diversity, I will choose an opponent from the Agent Archive that is of a different type than the last opponent (aggressive_type). The player has not faced many opponents of the projectile_type, so I will select an opponent from this category.

From the Agent Archive, I see that the projectile_type has a suggested character for Ryu, Ken, Sagat, and Dhalsim. Since the player is currently playing as Ryu, I will choose a different character to provide variety. Sagat is a good choice, as it is a projectile-based character that can provide a challenging experience for the player.

The difficulty score for the chosen agent model is 6/10-(Medium), which is suitable for the player's skill level.

Considering the player's feedback and the provided data, I will choose an opponent that is challenging but not overwhelming. The chosen agent type is projectile_type, the chosen agent model path is agent_models/agents_archive/projectile_type/2_0.2, and the chosen agent character is Sagat.
